#System analyst 
- Bridges the gap between persons who need computer and who understand technology
- study the problem and needs to determine to solve the problem.

#responsibilities of system anaylsis when information technology is used
- effiecient data capturing
- flow of data to computer
- process and storage of data
- flow of information to peaple and business

#How system analyst help the business.
- solving problem using concepts and information technology

#Role of system anlysist
- Business Analysist
	-- business problem and requirement analysis
- Application Analysist
	-- application design and technology

#System problem solving
- studying the problem and applying solution through new/improved system


#Other aspect System analysis is responsible
- people
- data
- processes
- interfaces
- networks

# Problem solving step
- understand the problem
- verify benifits of solving the problem
- define requirements for solving the problem
- decide which solution is best
- implement the solutin
- monitor to make sure the desired result is obtained

# Example of information system
- Transacion processing system 
	-- capture and records information that effect organization
	-- respond to business transaction and external, internal events
	-- eg: airline,bank,course,hotel,order and payrol system
- Management Information System
	-- takes information to process reports for planning and control
	-- detailed information: operation management
	-- Summary informaiton: consolidate raw data to predict trend
	-- Exception Information: filtering data to report (eg low inventory specific product)
	-- managed oriented reposting,shared databases of TPS.
	-- eg: budget,financial,inventory,production,scheduling and sales report
- Decision Support System
	-- Allows user to explore impact of availble solutions
	-- descision oriented information
	-- not solve problem ony provides information
	-- eg: MS Access, MS Excel, Reporting tools and Statistics
- Expert Decision System
	-- extension of DSS
	-- a program that simulates a problem solver would do to solve the problem from given data of DSS
	-- imitates logic and reasoning expert
	-- implemented with AI
- Office Automation
	-- create and share documents
- Communication Support System
	-- to communicate with each other
	-- eg: email,skype

# Required Skills for System Analysis
- Technical knowledge and skills
	-- computers and periphiral devices
	-- Tool: software like Ms Excel
	-- Techinique:  strategies like project planning
- Business Knowledge and skills
	-- must know how business run becuase they are there to solve the problem of the business
- People Knowledge and skills
	-- works with others people so this skill is important

[note]  a business anaylsist must know to program becuase it is the bridge between business users and computer users

@Chapter 2

# System developmen cycle
- Process of building ,deploying ,using and updating information system
- build, launch, and maintain an information

# Informataion development phases
- idea
- planning
- analysis
- design
- implementation

# System development life cycle
- Project Planning
	-- initiates,eansure fisibility, planning
- Analysis
	-- business needs and requirements
- Design
	-- desing solution
- Implementation
	--construct, test
- Suport
	-- keeps the system running productively

# cheif variation of SDLC
-Predective
	-- project can be planned out
	-- low technical task
-Adaptive
	-- more flexible, project cannot be planned out
	-- high techincal task

# Traditional predective sdlc approach
	

#pure waterfall approach
- sequential design process flowing steadily
- each phase must be complted sequentiall
- Dr. Winston W. Roycey

# Modified waterfall approach
- iterative waterfall
- has fedback 
- feedback path allows phases to be reworked

# Newer Adaptive approach
- Spiral model
	-- cycles until over
- Iterative model
	-- works is repeated
	-- refined each work after repeat

# Unified Process Life Cycle
- Inception
	-- vision of the system,scope,estimates
- Elaboration
	-- refine the vision,describe requirements, finalization
- Construction
	-- implementation, preparing for deployment
- Transition
	-- complete beta test for the users to use

# System development methodology
- provide guidelines for every actvity in system development
